                    <h4>Latte</h4>
                    <p>A latte, short for "caffè latte," is an Italian 
                        coffee drink made with one shot of espresso and 
                        steamed milk, topped with a small layer of milk 
                        foam. The combination of strong espresso and creamy 
                        milk creates a balanced, mellow flavor that is perfect 
                        for any time of day.</p>

                    I visit CoffeeShop daily, and I’m consistently impressed by the quality of their coffee and the professionalism of their staff. The pour-over coffee is a personal favorite—smooth and full of flavor. It's a great place to work or relax with a good book.

                neighborhoods.<br>CoffeeShop is dedicated to sustainability and ethical practices. We prioritize fair trade 
                and organic products and strive to minimize our environmental 
                footprint. From compostable cups to eco-friendly packaging,
                we're constantly seeking ways to be kinder to our
